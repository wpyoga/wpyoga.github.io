I just got a ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 AMD.

# Issues

- Sleep mode drains the battery
    - The T14 has S0ix ("Windows") and S3 ("Linux") sleep modes
    - S3 sleep drains more power than S0ix
- Sleep mode sometimes doesn't work
    - This seems to be a kernel version problem, and also a distro problem
    - Sometimes the laptop does not go to sleep, even if the lid is closed
- Waking up from sleep takes ~10 seconds
    - Waking up from sleep is instantaneous on Windows 
- TrackPoint stutters
- Screen ghosting / burn-in
    - Only visible on a gray screen
- Edges of the palmrest are sharp, unlike previous ThinkPads where the palmrest edges are slightly curved

# Improvements over previous ThinkPads

- Battery charge control now works by firmware
    - works without booting into the system
    - can be configured under `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0`:
        - `charge_control_end_threshold`
        - `charge_control_start_threshold`
- Thinner and lighter
