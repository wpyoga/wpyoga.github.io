title: Using DNF on an IPv6-only host
tags: [dnf, ipv6]

I created a Stardust instance on ScaleWay, and used IPv6 exclusively (didn't use IPv4, much cheaper this way).

The issue is, `dnf` would often not work. After using `-d 3` to figure out where it stalls, it became clear that `dnf` was resolving the mirror domain names to IPv4, and then failing to connect to them because we don't have IPv4.

<!-- truncate -->

The solution is to edit `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` and add this line:

```conf
ip_resolve=6
```

For other options, read the man page of `dnf.conf`.

There was some effort to enable a drop-in configuration diretory `/etc/dnf/conf.d`, but the patch never got merged.

Anyway, after reconfiguring DNF to resolve domain names to IPv6 only, it works fine.
